### Hi, Iâ€™m [Pedro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-ayala-9630a4176/).

I'm currently a skilled flooring installer looking to take my passion for technology to the next level as an AI Prompt Engineer. With over 2 years of experience in the flooring industry, I have developed a strong work ethic and attention to detail that translates well into my programming projects. My expertise lies in C++ and Python, and I have already created several successful prompts for LLMs on FlowGPT. 

I am highly motivated to innovate and revolutionize technology, especially in the field of AI, to help push humanity forward. My ultimate goal is to land a job as an AI Prompt Engineer, where I can apply my skills and contribute to the evolution of technology.
